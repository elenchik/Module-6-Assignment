Fashion MNIST Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with six layers using Keras in both Python and R to classify Fashion MNIST images.

Dataset:
Fashion MNIST is automatically loaded from Keras datasets.
Reference: https://keras.io/api/datasets/fashion_mnist/ 

How to Run:
Python:
- Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib`
- Run the file: `python python.py`

R:
- Install dependencies: `install.packages("keras")`, `library(keras)`, `install_keras()`
- Run the file in RStudio or terminal: `source('R-Assignment.R')`

Output:
- Model trains for 5 epochs.
- Displays test accuracy in the console.
- Predictions for 2 images are displayed with predicted and true labels.
